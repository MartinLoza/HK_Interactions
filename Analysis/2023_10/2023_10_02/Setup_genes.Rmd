I would like to create a bed file with the genes

```{r setup}
library(dplyr)

```

## Load data

load cres with their predicted targets

```{r}
genes <- readRDS("/Volumes/MARTIN_LOZA/Projects/Enhancer_Grammar/Data/Commonly_used/hg38/hg38_transcripts_universe_221121.rds")
```

## arrenge for bed

```{r}
genes <- genes %>% mutate(score = ".")
bed <- genes %>% select(chr, start, end, gene_name, score, strand)
```

## save as bed file

```{r}
write.table(x = bed, file = "/Volumes/MARTIN_LOZA/Projects/HK_Interactions/Data/Genes/transcripts_universe_221121.bed", sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```
